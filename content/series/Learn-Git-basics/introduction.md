Welcome to the magical world of Version control system(VCS). We use VCS to
manage history of code changes taki hamari life as a software developer easy ho.

Version control system ek special kind of database hai jo code me kiye huye har
modification ka track rakhta. If agar aapse code me koi galti hui ho to aapke
pas do hi option hai ya boss ki daat kha lo ya phir do some magic VCS and reset
your code previous working version. Chalo ab VCS ki bahot taarif kar li. Ab jara
thodi taarif Git ki bhi kar lete hai ;)

## What is Git ?
Git is by far most widely used version control used. Git ek mature aur open
source project maintained project hai jise 2005 me Linus Torvalds, the famous
creator of Linux Kernel ne banaya tha.

Git ek distribute version control system hai (DVCS) meaning k rather than saare
code history ko ek jagh store karne k instead har developer k pas ek working
copy of code hoga which also contains history of all changes. Its known as fork
( is baare me aage series me aur padhenge ).
